# BasicServerClient
Final project for CMPSC311: Programming in UNIX course.

The client and server program was created as a final project for CMPSC311: Programming in UNIX. These are intended to both be compiled in a UNIX environment.
Once ran, they can be used to transfer a single file over a network connection (given the right permissions) or between different local directories.
